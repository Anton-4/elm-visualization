module Visualization.Shape exposing (line, linearCurve, Curve)

{-| Visualizations typically consist of discrete graphical marks, such as symbols,
arcs, lines and areas. While the rectangles of a bar chart may be easy enough to
generate directly using SVG or Canvas, other shapes are complex, such as rounded
annular sectors and centripetal Catmullâ€“Rom splines. This module provides a
variety of shape generators for your convenience.

**Note:** Currently only rudimentary forms are implemented.

into drawing commands.

{-| Generates a line for the given array of points which can be passed to the `d`
attribute of the `path` SVG element. It needs to be suplied with a curve function.
Points accepted are `Maybe`s, Nothing represent gaps in the data and corresponding
gaps will be rendered in the line.

**Note:** A single point (surrounded by Nothing) may not be visible.
